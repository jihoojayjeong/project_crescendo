## Capstone Feedback project(Undergraduate Research)

- Frontend
    - Using React
    - It just have a basic functions such as giving feedbacks and see it by clicking 'history' button.

- Backend
    - Node.js, Mongo DB
    - Download MongoDB compass to see the data passed directly.

- To run frontend
    - cd to 'frontend' directory and run 'npm i' in the terminal. After installed, run 'npm start'. Make sure you are
    in the right directory.

- To run backend
    - cd to 'backend' directory and run 'npm i' in the terminal. After installed, run 'nrpm run dev' to connect the web to the server.

   ============================================

  I have dockerized both backend and frontend so you don't have to run front and back manually in the local terminal. If I host the container for this app, this app will run in localhost and you can use both front and backend at the same time.
