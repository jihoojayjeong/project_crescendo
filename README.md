**Motivation:**

Many undergraduate courses, especially senior-level courses, involve project-based learning. For example, the Computer Science department at VT has many capstone courses which are designed “to synthesize and integrate skills and knowledge acquired throughout the CS undergraduate curriculum, and which includes a significant design experience, where teamwork and written and oral communication are a key part of that design experience [

].“In such project-based courses, typically, professors ask students to give milestone presentations so that professors can check their progress, give feedback to each team, and allow students to see how other teams have made progress. By nature, getting feedback from milestone presentations can benefit the team in gaining ideas for improving the project and successful final artifacts.

Some instructors use a peer-assessment system so that peers’ evaluations will collectively determine the team’s grade for the presentation. Peer assessment has proven to have positive learning outcomes. Importantly, peer assessment is a social process; some claim that anonymity might have advantages. While it can be beneficial for students to learn from evaluating other students’ work, give constructive feedback, and receive feedback from others, students typically do not feel comfortable allowing their peers to determine their grades [

]. Students’ grading may be inconsistent across individuals, and some can even game the system in favor of their grades. If we only include peer-review feedback without grading, eliciting participation can be another challenge for instructors.

**PI’s teaching practice to address the problem:**

PI Lee has developed and applied a novel peer-review feedback system in his Creative Computing Studio capstone course that he taught four times. In this class activity, the peer-assessment system has been modified; the class gives feedback to a presenting team, and the presenting team evaluates the feedback they received from their peers based on the quality of the feedback. For example, Whenever there is a group presentation, the PI asks everyone in the class to give feedback to the presenting teams. For example, suppose there are ten teams of four students in a project-based class. In that case, each student will have to pay attention to everyone else’s presentations (9 presentations) except their own presentation and leave feedback in an online survey. The online survey has three types of feedback entries: “I like (positives),” “I wish (improvements),” and “What if (suggestions)” sections. Once those responses are collected, the PI anonymizes the feedback and gives feedback to the team. Then the team has to evaluate each peer’s feedback based on simple criteria. (e.g., is it specific? Is it justified? is it actionable? Is it positive? [

]). Then one student will get their grades from 9 different teams, eventually becoming the student’s final grade for the assignment (5% of the course grade). This crowdsourced peer-review system has been developed over four iterations of the same course and is now used consistently. Here’s a sample spreadsheet that one team received from their peers. The PI anticipates multiple benefits of this system. First, students can practice giving constructive feedback, as their grade depends on the quality of the feedback. Second, each team may take the crowdsourced feedback more seriously than the instructor’s feedback as they find some common theme that emerges from multiple students. Third, the entire class can develop a sense of community as they give feedback to their peers over the semester, witnessing the progress of each team as a result of forced peer-review systems.
